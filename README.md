Machine Part Picker - Desktop Quoting ApplicationA local-first desktop application built with Electron and Node.js to streamline the process of creating and managing quotes for complex machines and equipment. This project serves as a prototype to solve the inefficiencies of manual quoting, providing a centralized and reliable tool for sales and technical teams.📸 Application Demo(Placeholder for a GIF showing the application in action)📚 Table of Contents🚀 Key Features🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture⚙️ Getting Started📜 Available Scripts📄 License🚀 Key Features🗂️ Centralized Catalog: Manage components and prices in a local SQLite database.📂 Category Management: Organize components into logical, collapsible categories.✨ Full CRUD Operations: Easily Create, Read, Update, and Delete components and categories.🧾 Intuitive Quote Builder: Add components to a quote with a single click.🧮 Dynamic Calculations: Totals and sub-totals are updated instantly.💸 Flexible Discount System: Apply percentage or fixed-value discounts using the Strategy Pattern.💾 Persistent Storage: All created quotes are saved locally for future reference.⚡ Non-Blocking UI: Built on a fully asynchronous architecture to ensure a responsive, freeze-free experience.🛠️ Tech Stack & Architectural ConceptsThis project was built with a focus on creating a stable, maintainable, and performant desktop application.CategoryTechnology / ConceptCore FrameworkElectronBackend RuntimeNode.jsDatabaseSQLite (via the sqlite3 npm package)FrontendHTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)<details><summary><strong>Architectural Highlights</strong></summary>Asynchronous IPC: Uses Electron's Inter-Process Communication (IPC) model to ensure the UI (Renderer Process) never blocks while waiting for database operations handled by the Main Process.Design Patterns:Singleton: Used to manage a single, controlled connection to the SQLite database.Observer: Implemented in pure JavaScript to make the UI instantly reactive to changes in the quote's state.Strategy: Applied to the discount system, allowing for different calculation methods to be added or swapped flexibly.</details>⚙️ Getting StartedFollow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.PrerequisitesYou need to have Node.js (which includes npm) installed on your system.Installation & SetupClone the repository:git clone <your-repository-url>
cd MachinePartPicker
Install dependencies:npm install
Rebuild native modules (if necessary):If you encounter any issues with the SQLite module, run the electron-rebuild command.npm run rebuild
Set up the database:This script creates the orcamentos.db file and its internal tables. This step is mandatory before the first run.npm run db:setup
Populate the database with sample data (optional):To have a rich catalog of components to work with, run the populate script.npm run db:populate
Running the ApplicationOnce the setup is complete, you can start the application with:npm run start
This will launch the Electron desktop window.📜 Available ScriptsCommandDescriptionnpm run startStarts the Electron application.npm run db:setupCreates the database schema (tables).npm run db:populateFills the database with a large set of sample components and categories.npm run rebuildRebuilds native Node.js modules against the Electron version.📄 LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE.md file for details.
