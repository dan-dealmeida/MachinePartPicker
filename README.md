Machine Part Picker - Desktop Quoting ApplicationA local-first desktop application built with Electron and Node.js to streamline the process of creating and managing quotes for complex machines and equipment. This project serves as a prototype to solve the inefficiencies of manual quoting, providing a centralized and reliable tool for sales and technical teams.üöÄ Key FeaturesCentralized Component Catalog: Manage all machine parts and their prices in a local SQLite database.Category Management: Organize components into logical categories (e.g., Processors, GPUs, Storage).Full CRUD Operations: Easily Create, Read, Update, and Delete components and categories directly from the UI.Intuitive Quote Builder: Add components from the catalog to a new quote with a single click.Dynamic Calculations: Sub-totals and final totals are updated instantly as items are added or discounts are applied.Flexible Discount System: Apply percentage-based or fixed-value discounts to any quote.Persistent Storage: All created quotes are saved locally for future reference and management.Non-Blocking UI: Built on a fully asynchronous architecture to ensure the user interface is always responsive and never freezes during database operations.üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architectural ConceptsThis project was built with a focus on creating a stable, maintainable, and performant desktop application.Core Framework: ElectronBackend Runtime: Node.jsDatabase: SQLite (via the sqlite3 npm package)Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)Architectural HighlightsAsynchronous IPC: Uses Electron's Inter-Process Communication (IPC) model to ensure the UI (Renderer Process) never blocks while waiting for database operations handled by the Main Process.Design Patterns:Singleton: Used to manage a single, controlled connection to the SQLite database.Observer: Implemented in pure JavaScript to make the UI instantly reactive to changes in the quote's state.Strategy: Applied to the discount system, allowing for different calculation methods to be added or swapped flexibly.‚öôÔ∏è Getting StartedFollow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.PrerequisitesYou need to have Node.js (which includes npm) installed on your system.Installation & SetupClone the repository:git clone <your-repository-url>
cd MachinePartPicker
Install dependencies:This command will install all necessary packages, including Electron and the SQLite driver.npm install
Rebuild native modules (if necessary):If you encounter any issues with the SQLite module, run the electron-rebuild command.npm run rebuild
Set up the database:This script creates the orcamentos.db file and its internal tables. This step is mandatory before the first run.npm run db:setup
Populate the database with sample data (optional):To have a rich catalog of components to work with, run the populate script.npm run db:populate
Running the ApplicationOnce the setup is complete, you can start the application with:npm run start
This will launch the Electron desktop window.üìú Available ScriptsIn the project directory, you can run:npm run start: Starts the Electron application.npm run db:setup: Creates the database schema (tables).npm run db:populate: Fills the database with a large set of sample components and categories.npm run rebuild: Rebuilds native Node.js modules against the Electron version, used to fix runtime errors with packages like sqlite3.üìÑ LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE.md file for details.
